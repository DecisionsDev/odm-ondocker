This tutorial explains how to start an IBM Operational Decision Manager unclustered docker topology for development, using Docker Compose. It applies to Operational Decision Manager Standard V8.9.0.1 and to earlier versions up to v8.8.x.

## Setting up your environment
Before you proceed, install [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#installation-and-set-up).

### Install Operational Decision Manager
To create Operational Decision Manager docker images, install one of the following components:         
* Decision Center, with the WebSphere Liberty Profile option,
* Decision Server Rules, with the WebSphere Liberty Profile option.

Go to the Operational Decision Manager installation directory and locate the required WAR files in the directories listed below:

*installation_directory/executionserver/applicationservers/WLP855/res.war*

*installation_directory/executionserver/applicationservers/WLP855/DecisionService.war*

*installation_directory/teamserver/applicationservers/WLP855/teamserver.war*

*installation_directory/teamserver/applicationservers/WLP855/decisioncenter.war*

*installation_directory/executionserver/applicationservers/WLP855/DecisionRunner.war*

### Clone the odm-ondocker code

In the installation directory, enter ```git clone https://github.com/ODMDev/odm-ondocker.git```.

### Copy .dockerignore file

Copy the odm-ondocker/resources/.dockerignore file into the ODM installation directory.

```cp odm-ondocker/resources/.dockerignore ./```

When the copy is complete, the content of your repository should be similar to this:

### Verify that Docker Engine and Docker Compose are running.

Open a command prompt and run the following two commands:    	

  ```
    > docker -â€“version
    Docker version 1.12.3
    > docker-compose version
    docker-compose version 1.8.1
  ```

Now you are ready to build and run the docker images.

## Build and run the docker image
Open a command prompt in the directory **installation_directory/odm-ondocker** and run the following command:    	

```
docker-compose  up
```

This command builds, creates, and runs five docker containers:

* Derby Network database server
* ODM Decision Server runtime
* ODM Decision Server console
* ODM Decision Center
* ODM Decision Runner

Docker Compose builds and runs the containers if they are not already built.

You can also choose to start only one Operational Decision Manager component. For example, this command line starts Decision Center and its dependencies, including the dbserver Derby Network server.

```docker-compose up decisioncenter```

You can access the application with this URLs:

|Component|URL|Username|Password|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| [Decision Server Console](http://localhost:9080/res) | <http://localhost:9080/res> |resAdmin|resAdmin|
| [Decision Server Runtime](http://localhost:9090/DecisionService) |<http://localhost:9090/DecisionService> |N/A|N/A|
| [Decision Center Business Console]( http://localhost:9060/decisioncenter) |  <http://localhost:9060/decisioncenter> |rtsAdmin|rtsAdmin|
| [Decision Center Enterprise Console]( http://localhost:9060/teamserver) |  <http://localhost:9060/teamserver> |rtsAdmin|rtsAdmin|
| [Decision Runner]( http://localhost:9070/DecisionRunner) |  <http://localhost:9070/DecisionRunner> |resDeployer|resDeployer|


## Verifying the docker images

You can check the container status with the following command:
```
 docker-compose ps
```
 This screen capture displays the list of running containers.
