# New: IBM Container Registry

IBMÂ® is now hosting product images on the IBM Container Registry, *icr.io*. You can obtain the IBM Operational Decision Manager for Developers image without authenticating by using this IBM-controlled source: *icr.io/cpopen/odm-k8s/odm*.

```console
docker pull icr.io/cpopen/odm-k8s/odm
```

-	**Rule Designer development environment for ODM developers**:  
	Available from the [Eclipse marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ibm-operational-decision-manager-developers-v-812x-rule-designer)
	Use [IDE 2022-06 R (4.24) Modeling Tools Packages](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2022-06/r). The update site is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DecisionsDev/ruledesigner/8.12.0/p2

-	**Sample projects**:

	Two decision services can be directly used in Decision Center when you set the SAMPLE option to true as described in the Usage section below:
	- Loan Validation Service

	This decision service validates loans based on borrower data and loan parameters. It also computes loan insurance rates.

	- Shipment Pricing

	This decision model service computes shipping prices based on data that includes distance, size, weight, and pick-up and drop-off points.

	You can explore the decision artifacts, tests and simulations of these projects in the Business console.

	- Loan-Server Web Application

	This sample application uses rules from the Loan Validation Service to process loans.

	You can use the application to test the Loan Validation Service with parameters entered by you.

# Overview

  The image in this repository contains IBM Operational Decision Manager for Developers based on the IBM Websphere Application Server Liberty for Developer image. See the license section below for restrictions on the use of this image. For more information about IBM Operational Decision Manager, see the [ODM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/odm/8.12.0?topic=manager-introducing-operational-decision) site.


  # Usage

The ODM for Developers docker image contains all of the IBM Operational Decision Manager components, so that you can evaluate the product.

> **Note**: On some operating systems like Mac OS X, you might need to increase the memory allocated to docker to be able to run the image. Allocate at least 4 GigaBytes (GB) to your docker daemon to be able to use all of the features in the docker image.

> On Mac OS X, click Docker > Preferences > Advanced, and set the memory to 4 GB. You must restart docker to apply the change.

The image contains a server that is preconfigured with a database accessible through HTTP port 9060 and HTTPS port 9443.
You must accept the license before you launch the image. The license is available at the bottom of this page.
To install the product with the sample projects, you need to specify the option -e SAMPLE=true. To be able to run simulations, you need to increase the size of the memory. Use the following docker command to run the image:

```console
docker run -e LICENSE=accept -p 9060:9060 -p 9443:9443  -m 2048M --memory-reservation 2048M  -e SAMPLE=true icr.io/cpopen/odm-k8s/odm:8.12
```

Some decision artifacts, like simulation definitions, version history, or snapshots, cannot be exported from the Decision Center or the Decision Server instances of the Docker image. To avoid losing this data when you delete the Docker image container, store the Decision Center and the Decision Server databases outside of the ODM for Developers Docker image container, in a local mounted host volume. To do so, run the following docker command from an empty local folder:

 ```console
docker run -e LICENSE=accept  -m 2048M --memory-reservation 2048M -p 9060:9060 -p 9443:9443 -v $PWD:/config/dbdata/ -e SAMPLE=false  icr.io/cpopen/odm-k8s/odm:8.12
```

When you first run this command, it creates the .db files in your local folder. The following times, it reads and updates these files.

When the server is started, use the URL http://localhost:9060 to display a welcome page that lists all the ODM components. You can also directly access the individual components through the following URLs:

|Component|URL|Username|Password|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| [Decision Server console](http://localhost:9060/res) | http://localhost:9060/res |odmAdmin|odmAdmin|
| [Decision Server Runtime](http://localhost:9060/DecisionService) | http://localhost:9060/DecisionService |odmAdmin|odmAdmin|
| [Decision Center Business console]( http://localhost:9060/decisioncenter) | http://localhost:9060/decisioncenter |odmAdmin|odmAdmin|
| [Decision Runner]( http://localhost:9060/DecisionRunner) | http://localhost:9060/DecisionRunner |odmAdmin|odmAdmin|
